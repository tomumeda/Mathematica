I found your paper very useful to my study of twisted spectral triples.
The following is a list of some errors and omissions I found.

Page 3:
"i" in "t=i" not explained.

Page 17:
"in and only if" should be "if and only if".
The "*" in "N*" not explained.

Page 21:
In (5.5), (5.6), (5.7) the second "f" should be "g".
"Script[J] p-" should be "J p-".
