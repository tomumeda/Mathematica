This repository contains Mathematica notebooks and collections of Modules.  
The notebooks have been created in the study of various physics topics: group theory, quantum field theory, gravitation, 
AdS/CFT correspondence, entanglement entropy, cosmology, etc.  The notebooks deal with problem sets from text books
and lectures, lecture notes, and disections of physics papers.
Include are collections of Modules and definitions that have been useful in the creation of these notebooks. 
These collections have been developing over the several years, so that, unfortunately, the older notebooks may not
work.
